Apache Arrow provides a [`Dataset`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/dataset.html) API, which acts as an abstraction over a collection of files in different storage backends like S3 and HDFS. It supports different file formats like CSV and Parquet through the [`FileFormat`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/dataset.html#_CPPv4N5arrow7dataset10FileFormatE) API. In SkyhookDM, we create a new file format called `SkyhookFileFormat` on top of `ParquetFileFormat`, which besides providing all the features of Parquet allows offloading file fragment scan operations into the storage backend. Offloading scan operations increases the query performance many folds, provides better scalability, and results in less network traffic. 

# Getting Started

**NOTE:** Please make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is installed.

* Clone the repository. The default branch gets cloned.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uccross/arrow
```

* Run the `ubuntu-cls-demo` step in the docker-compose file. This step will start a single node Ceph cluster inside the container, mount CephFS, put sample data into CephFS, and open an example Jupyter notebook with PyArrow installed.
```bash
cd demo/
docker build -t skyhook-demo .
docker run -p 8888:8888 --privileged skyhook-demo:latest ./script.sh
```

# Installation Instructions

* For installing SkyhookDM-Arrow with [Rook](https://rook.io) on Kubernetes, check out [this](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-arrow-docker/blob/master/README.md#deploying-skyhookdm-arrow-on-a-rook-cluster) guide.

* For installing SkyhookDM-Arrow on CloudLab, check out [this](https://github.com/uccross/skyhookdm-workflows/tree/master/cloudlab#deploy-ceph-skyhookdm-on-cloudlab) guide. To deploy SkyhookDM on bare-metal in general, check out [this](docs/deploy.md) guide.

# Salient Features

* Enables pushing down filters, projections, compute operations to the Storage backend for minimal data transfer over the network.

* Allows storing data in Parquet files for minimizing Disk I/O though predicate and projection pushdown.

* Plugs-in seamlessly into the Arrow Dataset API and leverages all its functionality like dataset discovering,  partition pruning, etc.

* Minimal overhead in requirements: 
    1) Requires CephFS to be mounted. 
    2) Requires using the [`SplittedParquetWriter`](../../../../../python/pyarrow/rados.py) API to write arrow Tables.

* Built on top of latest Ceph v15.2.x.

# Code Structure

### Client side - C++

* [`file_skyhook.h`](../../dataset/file_skyhook.h): This file contains the definitions of 3 APIs. The `RadosConnection` , `SkyhookDirectObjectAccess`, and the `SkyhookFileFormat`. The `RadosConnection` API helps create a connection to the Ceph cluster and provides a handle to the cluster that can be passed around. The `SkyhookDirectObjectAccess` API provides abstractions for converting filenames in CephFS to object IDs in the Object store and allows interacting with the objects directly. The `SkyhookFileFormat` API takes in the direct object access construct as input and contains the logic of pushing down scans to the underlying objects that make up a file. This file also contains functions for (de)serializing scan options and query results into `ceph::bufferlist` using Flatbuffers for sending them over the network.

* [`rados.h`](../../dataset/rados.h): Contains a wrapper for the `librados` SDK for exposing `librados` methods like `init2`, `connect`, `stat`, `ioctx_create`, and `exec` which are required for establishing the connection to the Ceph cluster and for operating on objects directly. 

### Client side - Python

* [`_rados.pyx`](../../../../../python/pyarrow/_rados.pyx): Contains Cython bindings to the `SkyhookFileFormat` C++ API.

* [`rados.py`](../../../../../python/pyarrow/rados.py): This file contains the definition of the `SplittedParquetWriter`. It is completely implemented in Python.

### Storage side

* [`cls_arrow.cc`](./cls_arrow.cc): Contains the Rados objclass functions and APIs for interacting with objects in the OSDs. Also, it includes a `RandomAccessObject` API to give a random access file view of objects for allowing operations like reading byte ranges, seeks, tell, etc.
